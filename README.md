Dataset Used

We are using the Wisconsin Breast Cancer Data Set.

Dataset Description

This data was donated by researchers of the University of Wisconsin and includes the measurements
from digitized images of fine-needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass.
The breast cancer data includes 569 examples of cancer biopsies, each with 32 features. One feature
is an identification number, another is the cancer diagnosis and 30 are numeric-valued laboratory
measurements, which describe the characteristics of the cell nuclei present in the image. The
diagnosis is coded as "M" to indicate malignant or "B" to indicate benign.
The other 30 numeric measurements comprise the mean, standard error and worst (i.e. largest) value
for 10 different characteristics of the digitized cell nuclei, which are as follows:-
i. Radius
ii. Texture
iii. Perimeter
iv. Area
v. Smoothness
vi. Compactness
vii. Concavity
viii. Concave Points
ix. Symmetry
x. Fractal dimension

Research Question

We shall be answering the question of whether the aspirate (lump) is malignant (cancerous) or benign
(harmless), given a few of the sample parameters of breast mass aspirate, therefore aiming to achieve
the highest possible accuracy in correctly diagnosing a patient with regards to breast cancer.
